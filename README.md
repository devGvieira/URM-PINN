# PINN for Uniform Rectilinear Motion

Project for development of a Physics-Informed Neural Network to predict Uniform Rectilinear Motions. The tools applied here include PyTorch, Jupyter Notebooks and, evidently, Python itself.   

One should note that this work is, at the moment, being developed for study purposes and is not yet intended for direct applications.
